const express = require('express');

// Create an Express app
const app = express();

// Initialize the counter
let counter = 0;

// Endpoint to get the current counter value
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ counter });
});

// Endpoint to increment the counter
app.post('/increment', (req, res) => {
  counter++;
  res.json({ counter });
});

// Endpoint to decrement the counter
app.post('/decrement', (req, res) => {
  counter--;

In this code, we're using Express to create an application. We have defined three endpoints:

The '/' endpoint responds with the current counter value as JSON.

The /increment endpoint increments the counter by 1 when a POST request is made to it. It then responds with the latest counter value as JSON.

The /decrement endpoint decrements the counter by 1 when a POST request is made to it. It also responds with the updated counter value as JSON.

The counter variable keeps track of the current counter value and is updated accordingly.

You can send HTTP requests to the specified endpoints (/, /increment, /decrement) to interact with the counter. The responses will contain the updated counter value.

Remember to install the Express module by running npm install express before running this code.
