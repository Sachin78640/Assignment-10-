Express is actually built on top of Node.js, so it's not a matter of choosing Express over Node.js. Instead, Express is a web application framework that simplifies and enhances the capabilities of Node.js for building web applications. Here are some reasons why developers choose Express over using Node.js alone:

Simplicity: Express provides a simpler and more intuitive API compared to the core Node.js HTTP module. It abstracts away many low-level details, making it easier to build web applications quickly.

Routing: Express offers a robust routing system that allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods and URL patterns. It simplifies the task of handling various requests and mapping them to the appropriate functions or middleware.

Middleware Support: Express has excellent middleware support. Middleware functions can be used to add functionality, perform tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Express makes it easy to write and organize middleware functions, enabling code reusability.

Templating Engines: Express has built-in support for popular templating engines like EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), and Handlebars. These engines make it easy to generate dynamic HTML content on the server side, facilitating the creation of dynamic web pages.

Error Handling: Express provides a convenient way to handle errors in middleware functions. You can define error handling middleware that gets executed when an error occurs, allowing you to centralize error handling logic and provide meaningful error responses.

Ecosystem and Community: Express has a large and active community with a vast ecosystem of third-party modules and plugins. This means you can easily find solutions and libraries for common tasks, such as authentication, database integration, API development, and more.

Flexibility: Express is highly flexible and unopinionated. It doesn't impose strict conventions on how you structure your application or handle requests. This flexibility allows you to design your application architecture according to your specific needs.

It's important to note that Node.js itself provides the foundation for building web applications, and you can certainly build web applications directly using Node.js. However, by using Express, you can leverage its features, simplicity, and ecosystem to streamline development, increase productivity, and enhance the overall developer experience.
